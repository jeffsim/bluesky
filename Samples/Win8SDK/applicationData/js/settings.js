    // Guidance for Settings.
    //
    // Settings are a convenient way of storing small pieces of configuration data
    // for your application.
    //
    // Settings can be either Local or Roaming.
    //
    // Roaming settings will be synchronized across machines on which the user has
    // signed in with a Microsoft Account.  Roaming of settings is not instant; the
    // system weighs several factors when determining when to send the data.  Usage
    // of roaming data should be kept below the quota (available via the 
    // RoamingStorageQuota property), or else roaming of data will be suspended.
    //
    // User preferences for your application are a great match for roaming settings.
    // User preferences are usually fixed in number and small in size.  Users will
    // appreciated that your application is customized the way they prefer across
    // all of their machines.
    //
    // Local settings are not synchronized and remain on the machine on which they
    // were originally written.
    //
    // Care should be taken to guard against an excessive volume of data being
    // stored in settings.  Settings are not intended to be used as a database.
    // Large data sets will take longer to load from disk during your application's
    // launch.

    // This sample illustrates reading and writing from a local setting, though a
    // roaming setting could be used just as easily.

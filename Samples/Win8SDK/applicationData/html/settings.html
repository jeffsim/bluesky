            The primary way to store settings for an app is to save them as key-value pairs in either 
            <b>Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.current.localSettings</b> or <b>Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.current.roamingSettings</b>. Use 
            <b>localSettings</b> for settings that are specific to a device, or use 
            <b>roamingSettings</b> to transition settings between a user's PCs.  For roaming, also refer to the HighPriority and the DataChanged Event scenarios.  
        </p>
        <p>
            This scenario writes, reads, and clears a setting in <b>roamingSettings</b>.

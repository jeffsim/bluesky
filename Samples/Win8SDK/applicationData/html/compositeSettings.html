            Composite settings are used to group multiple settings. It is useful for storing related settings or settings that always get changed together. Note that these are treated as one atomic unit during roaming conflict resolution.

        <p>
            Use <b>Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.current.roamingSettings</b> and <b>Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataCompositeValue</b> to read, write, and delete a composite setting.

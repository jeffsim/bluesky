## What is bluesky?
Bluesky is a *BETA* re-implementation of the WinJS API for the Web, enabling WinJS developers to publish their WinJS apps to more marketplaces, 
including Facebook AppCenter, Google WebStore, Firefox Marketplace, or any website at all. We're also working on enabling developers to
ship their WinJS apps on iOS, Android, and WP8 phones and tablets.  Richer Intranet support is on the short-list of features for Enterprise users
as well.

within an enterprise for internal apps (e.g. on a private intranet) requires an Enterprise License.  See the license.txt file that came with this
